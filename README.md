  * The book integrates information from the various fields, including pharmacology, neuroscience, psychology and psychiatry, to provide a broad perspective on how drugs affect behavioral processes.
 
Drugs, Brain and Behavior describes the psychological effects of drugs, and how drug actions can be understood in terms of effects on the brain. This discussion includes drugs that are used for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, as well as common drugs of abuse. Rather than simply focusing on drug dependence and addiction, this text also places considerable emphasis on drug treatments for various psychiatric disorders such as: schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, parkinsonism, ADHD and Alzheimer’s disease. It also combines neurotransmitter-based approaches to the field with perspectives that emphasize specific drugs and distinct drug categories. Intended for Undergraduate courses in Psychopharmacology and/or Drugs and Behavior, this new edition of Drugs, Brain, and Behavior provides an overview of the field of psychopharmacology, which focuses on the behavioral effects of drugs.
